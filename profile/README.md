Hey, CG here:
I want to annouce the next big change in StreamFlare.
By Q2 2025 (no promises), StreamFlare / StreamFlareJS / StreamFlareUI will also have support for SoundCloud, etc... ðŸ‘€
After i'm done, i'm firstly going to make only py terminal version with extra support, but later (if the project goes well and it works fine) i'm going to do JS and UI versions.
