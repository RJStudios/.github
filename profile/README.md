## Welcome to RJ Studios - Github!

### We are an indie studio making different things such as designing and coding (for now)

Need to know fact: RJ stands for Really Janky, so we are called Really Janky Studios!

RJ is consisted of 2 people for now: [Andrecon](https://andrecon.cgcristi.xyz) and [CGCristi](https://cgcristi.xyz)

Andrecon is the designer of the team, while CGCristi does all the behind the scenes with the code.
